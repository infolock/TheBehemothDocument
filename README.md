=====================

## About this Document
This is a compilation of information I’ve gathered over the years either for interview preparation, while researching a language/feature/etc., or referred to by a friend.  Very little (maybe a few sentences here and there) are things I’ve written up (which you should be able to identify easily).

## Who this Document is NOT Intended for
This document is not intended for those who wish to be considered a prodigy over a phone screen. If, however, you use this during your phone screens just to make it to the in-person interview – well, be prepared for the fact that you may never be invited back, may be exposed publically, and may even find yourself unable to land another interview at any other company.  Just saying...  Not for you.  K.

## Who this Document IS Intended for
This document is intended for anyone who understands the majority of the context within this document, and are simply looking for something to work as a refresher to some core concepts, definitions and terminology that you may need help remembering.

## What is Contained Inside
There are 3 main parts to this document:
### Software Engineer Interview Concepts to Review
This contains the material I go over to get a good refresher of common “definitions” that I’ve been asked almost every interview.  This is not a complete or definitive list, but it’s damn close.  Feel free to add whatever I’m missing although there probably won’t be much.

### Helpful Books
This is currently a small list of books I currently wrote down but it will be updated as time permits.  These books are intended to help you study for the actual interview, learn about a specific language, or be a good resource for brushing up on some core concepts listed in the Software Engineer Interview Concepts to Review section of this document.

### Boatload of URLs
This is a collection of links that helped me build what is in this document.  I have trimmed it a lot (believe it or not) – mainly to reduce repetitive domain references (and to shorten the list overall).  However, it still remains quite large.  Want to make it a larger collection?  Send me some suggestions and I may add to this over sized monstrosity.  Maybe... 

## Acknowledgements
Um.. hmm... Well!  …shit.  As I said this is a collection I’ve been compiling for almost 10 years now.  Sorry but I have no idea who to thank, quote, or anything like that. If you know the source to something here – please – let me know and I’ll update.  Otherwise – your best guess is mine.  

Either way – I hope this document is useful to someone.  

Enjoy!
